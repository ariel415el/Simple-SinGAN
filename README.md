A simple unofficial Pytorch implementation of [SinGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)

This implementation can also run with multiple input images or copies of the same image
# Run
edit the image paths main.py and run 
```
python3 main.py 
```

Here are 16 samples from a model trained on "Images/balloons.png"
